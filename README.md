# PROVATO Project

I have participated in the PROVATO project, a smart livestock monitoring platform developed by:

- Software & Databases Systems Laboratory (SoDa.Lab, University of the Peloponnese)
- Computer Networks & Services Laboratory (CONSERT Lab, University of West Attica)
- Laboratory of Nutritional Physiology & Feeding (NPF, Agricultural Univ. of Athens)

The PROVATO project is part of the Horizon Europe [AGRARIAN](https://agrarian-project.eu/) project.

This research activity is carried out from May to November 2025.

## Overview
PROVATO is a precision livestock farming platform integrating edge AI, IoT, and NGSO satellite connectivity for real-time monitoring of animal health and welfare. Wearable sensors on livestock collect physiological, behavioural, and environmental data, including meteorological data, which are processed locally and in the cloud using machine learning. The system delivers predictive insights and alerts (FETA: Flock Emergency and Temperature Alerts) to farmers via mobile devices, supporting effective decision-making in specific areas.

## GitHub Organization for PROVATO
There is a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Project-Provato) for the PROVATO project.

## My contribution to PROVATO
Within the PROVATO organization, the repository [meteorological-data](https://github.com/Project-Provato/meteorological-data) contains my work on the collection and processing of meteorological data for PROVATO. Meteorological data, sourced from reliable online platforms, provide essential environmental parameters and context for interpreting animal health and behaviour.

### More updates are coming soon.
